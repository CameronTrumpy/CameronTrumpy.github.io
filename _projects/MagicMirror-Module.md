In 2019, I designed and built my own Magic Mirror, which runs on a Raspberry Pi, and makes use of the open source [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://magicmirror.builders) platform. After I had built and set up the project, I got caught up with other projects and responsibilities, and never took the project further. 
 
During the beginning of quarantine in 2020, I was spending more time at home, and needed a final project for my AP Computer Science A course. I subsequently wrote my own module for the mirror, which displayed state level and national COVID-19 statistics. 
 
This project helped me learn a bit about Node JS, and I published the Module on my github page for anyone to download and try on their own.
