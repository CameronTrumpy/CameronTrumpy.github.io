In 2022 I worked on stepping up my CAD skills a little bit further. I relied on Fusion360 for design, and 3D printed a wide range of models. 


## 1 - USB Webcam Hardcase

This case was designed as a "rugged" protective case to hold my small wireless earbuds case. Often dust and dirt can get into the charging case so an outer hardcase design makes this much less of an issue when tossed in a bag, set on a desk, etc.

## 2 - EBike Kickstand Repair

This piece is a replica of a spring retainer piece which fits into a bike kickstand. Soon after I purchased my commuter bike, the kickstand's spring retainer piece shattered and the kickstand no longer worked. I ended up drawing the retainer piece in CAD and successfully repaired the kickstand.

## 3 - Jetson Nano Case


## 4 - Earbuds Charging Stand - JBL Live TWS 

My older wireless earbuds didn't stand up too well on a table, and when charging had to be set down sideways. This charging stand allowed the charging case to be both portable, and function as a stationary charging dock for the earbuds.
