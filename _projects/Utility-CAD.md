In 2022 I worked on my CAD skills a little bit further. I relied on Fusion360 for design, and 3D printed a wide range of models. 


## 1 - USB Webcam Hardcase

This case was designed as a "rugged" protective case to hold my small wireless earbuds case. Often dust and dirt can get into the charging case so an outer hardcase design makes this much less of an issue when tossed in a bag, set on a desk, etc.

## 2- Earbuds Charging Stand - JBL Live Free

My JBL Live Free Earbuds are fantastic, and I wanted to make a carrying case for their charging case so that they would pick up less dust over time. This carrying case also made it nicer for storing them inside bags and not losing them, since it made their footprint a bit larger and easier to spot.

## 3 - EBike Kickstand Repair

This piece is a replica of a spring retainer piece which fits into a bike kickstand. Soon after I purchased my commuter bike, the kickstand's spring retainer piece shattered and the kickstand no longer worked. I ended up drawing the retainer piece in CAD and successfully repaired the kickstand.

## 4 - Earbuds Charging Stand - JBL Live TWS 

My older wireless earbuds didn't stand up too well on a table, and when charging had to be set down sideways. This charging stand allowed the charging case to be both portable, and function as a stationary charging dock for the earbuds.
