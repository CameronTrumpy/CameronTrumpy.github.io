The *pomodoro technique*, is a well-researched productivity method, where one highly focuses on their assignment/work for 25 minutes, and then takes a five minute break.

My design uses a physical pomodoro timer that also monitors if you are distracted by your phone. This results in easier following of this technique, with an added layer of responsibility taken off of the user.

The project usess ESP-8266 arduino microcontroller along with a 16x2 character LCD display and a few buttons to interface with the timer. The timer keeps track of your work and break time for you, and beeps to notify completion of a pomodoro cycle. It also monitors if you have picked up your phone during work time, and beeps to notify the user that they are distracted.

I designed the housing in Fusion360, and programmed the project in Arduino.

Overall, it ended up being an effective application of a well-researched productivity method, and helped me study for the SAT and my schoolwork with less distractions.
