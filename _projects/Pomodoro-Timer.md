The *pomodoro technique*, is a well-researched productivity method, where one hyper-focuses on their assignment/work for 25 minutes, and then takes a five minute break. After 4 pomodoros, a 15-30 minute break is taken.

I designed a physical pomodoro timer, which also monitors if you are distracted by your phone. This results in easier application of this technique, with a layer of responsibility taken off of the user.

The timer features ESP-8266 arduino microcontroller along with a 16x2 character LCD display and a few buttons for user interaction. The timer displays your work and break time for you, and beeps to notify completion of a pomodoro cycle. It also monitors if you have picked up your phone during work time, and beeps to notify the user that they are distracted.

I designed the housing in Fusion360, and programmed the project in Arduino.

Overall, it ended up being an effective application of a well-researched productivity method, and helped me study for the SAT and my schoolwork with less distractions. My GitHub Repository includes a README which explains how to make your own PomBox.
