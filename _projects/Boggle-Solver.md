In 2019, I wrote a Java program which works alongside an emulated android device. This program quickly and accurately searches all word combinations possible given a match's auto generated boggle board, and then enters all words in at much faster than human speeds. It outperformed human opponents by 10000% and was able to easily win in game tournaments against high skill opponents.
I didn't want to ruin anyone else's experience in playing the game, so I only tested it against human players who I knew.
