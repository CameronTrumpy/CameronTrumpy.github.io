This is a current project, and serves as a learning experience for me in regards to web development. I am most familiar with object oriented programming, so web development is not something I am used to. This site also is where I can document the rest of my projects and other information about me.

This page is hosted on Github Pages, and is supported by the Jekyll Framework for static sites.
