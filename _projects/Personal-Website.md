This project started in 2021, and served as a learning experience for me in regards to web development. I was most familiar with object oriented programming, so web development was new to me. Now the site is where I document the rest of my projects and other information about me.

This page is hosted on Github Pages, and is supported by the Jekyll Framework for static sites.
