In 2017 I was in 8th grade, and I designed and programmed a Web Controlled LED strip for my desk. I was very proud of it and I wanted to share it, so I wrote and published a how-to guide for the project on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/WebsiteWiFi-Controlled-LED-Strip-With-Raspberry-Pi/). This guide has now gained over 10K+ views and was a featured project on the front page when I published it.

This project was my first legitimate experience with with a Raspberry Pi and Linux-based systems. It was also a great introduction to circuit design and documentation of a project.
