summary: "Custom Light Fixture Project"
---
My main summer CAD project was designing a lighting fixture which could mount in the top corner of a room. This was a goal of mine as I wanted quality lighting for my dorm room, without disturbing the amount of floor space available, or installing a tacky looking LED strip and calling it a day. I found some lighting fixtures that looked slightly like what I wanted on Amazon, but each fixture was over $50 and needed to be screwed into the wall. 

The Trifecta Light Fixture allows for the hanging of a standard A26 style bulb, in the top corner of a room. It's low profile design allows for more floor space and a stylish yet non-intrusive feel.

Installed in each Fixture is a Wifi Enabled 800 lumen LED lightbulb. This allows either individual control or integration with smart home systems. I automated the lights by connecting them to my HomeAssistant setup, which has motion detection and other features to enhance the lighting experience.

As seen from the front, the 3D printed corners capture aluminum extrusions and the diffuser panel.

As seen from the rear, the lightbulb is hung behind the panel. Not pictured is the cord and socket for the bulb.
