As edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi become increasingly powerful, smaller scale machine learning applications have become accessible for countless scenarios. One case, which is explored in this project, is mobile object detection and tracking.

This guide takes the user through setting up their environment, collecting data, training their TensorFlow model, and exporting to TF.JS and TensorFlow Lite.
