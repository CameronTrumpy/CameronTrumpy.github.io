    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Introduction & Core Values</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">My name is Cameron Trumpy. I am a High School Senior who is
            passionate about many subjects including programming, robotics, electrical engineering, music, etc!
            I believe that when engineers design hardware and software, we have a responsiblity to create in a way that brings about a world
            more equitable and inclusive for all, regardless of background, identity, etc. This takes many different forms depending on the type of work being done,
            but should always be a priority.</p>
        <h2>My Programming Journey</h2> 
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
            My programming journey began in series with my robotics experience, when I started my own Lego NXT robot group in elementary school. 
            I continued this interest when I was old enough to join a small FLL Lego robotics team. At a young age, Lego block programming 
            introduced me to the fundamentals of object oriented programming, and shortly after I was introduced to Java. Since then, 
            I have spent every year participating in FIRST Robotics, and I am currently am one of two programming group leads on my high school's robotics team.
            I believe FIRST is an exemplary organization in regards to their efforts to make engineering an equitable and inclusive field, and I am extrmely proud
            to have spent the time I have involved in it.</p>
