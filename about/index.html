	<h1>About Me</h1> 
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">My name is Cameron Trumpy. I am a High School student who is
        passionate about many subjects including programming, robotics, electrical engineering, music, etc.</p>
    <h2>My Programming Journey</h2> 
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">My programming journey began in series with my robotics experience, when I got my own Lego NXT robot in elementary school. I continued this interest when I joined a small FLL Lego robotics team. This Lego block programming introduced me to the fundamentals of object oriented programming, and shortly after I was introduced to Java. Since then, I have spent every year participating in FIRST Robotics, and I am currently one of the main robot programmers on my high school's robotics team.</p>
