Hey! Currently, I am working on deciding if this is how I want this page set up. It is currently running with jekyll on github pages.
Once I get more free time over the summer, I plan to fully flesh out this site and update it with all my projects and info.

Right now, I am also working on setting up an Ubuntu 20.04(LTS) installation on my desktop machine. 
I am getting this set up so I can train TensorFlow models for upcoming R&D for my FRC team, as we are planning to do some work on ML based vision systems over this summer.

Thats all for now!
