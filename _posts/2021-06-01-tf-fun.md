As the summer gets nearer, I'm continuing my work on preparing for developing an AI vision system. Over the past weekend, I have been following through an awesome [guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U) on YouTube. I successfully got through the first half which covers setting up your environment, collecting data, and training/testing procedures. 

I ordered and soon should be receiving a Google Coral USB Accelerator, which should significantly improve model performance when I export my models to TFLite for use on a Raspberry Pi. I am extremely excited to get working on this summer project, and I can't wait to have the time to work on this and help collaborate with my other teammates on it.
