Between work, robotics, marching band, college planning, and personal projects, this summer has been a very busy one. Despite that, it has been busy in a very good way. 

I've been making good progresson my Tensorflow Object detection for FRC and I'm approaching performance levels high enough to be practical in-match. I've reached a processing rate of about 20 frames per second, which means it becomes practical for use in match, on-robot. Preparations for offseason robotics competitions is our main focus at robotics right now, with major improvements to our autonomous controls being done. I am hoping that I can work on integrating my vision system onto the robot by competition season this upcoming year.

I have been learning PCB design using Autodesk Eagle, and I have a bunch of project ideas that in the future this would be super helpful for! Most of the stuff I've worked on right now is very simple, but it has been a great learning experience.s
