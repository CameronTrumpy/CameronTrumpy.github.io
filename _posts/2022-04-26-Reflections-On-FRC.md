title: "Reflections on FIRST & FRC's Impact on My Life"

This post is a bit of a walkthrough and internal reflection on my past 8 years as a member of some form of FIRST robotics team, with a focus on my involvement in the past 4 years of being a member of FRC Team 503, Frog Force.

I unofficially began my FIRST journey in 2nd grade, when my attention was gained by my elementary school computer lab's Lego NXT robots. At the time I wasn't old enough to participate in the FLL(First Lego League) program, but it sparked an excitement in me that carried into my upper elementary years.










I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities that have been given to me through FIRST robotics. I would not be who I am today, if not for the countless hours spent by parents, mentors, volunteers, and the rest of the network which supports the FIRST community.
